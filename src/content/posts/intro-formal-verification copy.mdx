Formal verification is a technique for proving the correctness of software and hardware systems using mathematical methods...

## What is Formal Verification?

Formal verification uses mathematical proofs to establish that a system behaves according to its specification. Unlike testing, which can only show the presence of bugs, formal verification can prove their absence.

## Why Does It Matter?

In safety-critical systems—aviation, medical devices, financial systems—bugs can have catastrophic consequences. Formal verification provides the highest level of assurance that software will behave correctly.
