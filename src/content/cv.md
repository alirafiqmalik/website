experience:
  - title: Graduate Research Assistant
    company: Khwarizmi Lab, University of Massachusetts Amherst
    location: Amherst, MA
    year: September 2023 - Present
    responsibilities:
      - Built a verification framework to analyze quantum key distribution (QKD) protocols; identified four new vulnerabilities arising from quantum–classical interactions
      - Applied formal analysis to U.S. ACH banking systems to uncover security vulnerabilities in the access control and authorization of ACH direct payments
  - title: Undergraduate Research Assistant
    company: Communication Systems and Networks Lab, NUST
    location: Islamabad
    year: September 2022 - July 2023
    responsibilities:
      - Collaborated in the design and implementation of an event-driven coordination protocol for multi-agent aerial swarms on Raspberry Pi companion computers with Pixhawk/ArduPilot flight controllers
      - Designed and optimized leader–follower formation control (flock, line, helical) with dynamic reconfiguration, achieving under 2 min formation-switching latency
      - Engineered a mesh networking stack (IEEE 802.11, UDP/TCP, MAVLink) to enable fault-tolerant communication for control coordination in real-time (under 100 ms latency)
  - title: Hardware Security Intern
    company: IC Design Lab, NUST
    location: Islamabad
    year: June 2022 - September 2022
    responsibilities:
      - Led the design of ENIGMA, a Python framework that automatically inserts logic-locking defenses into hardware designs, protecting IP designs from unauthorized use and reverse engineering
      - Designed a parametrized key-insertion system (64–256 bits) with user-defined cell libraries to analyze the impact of logic obfuscation on a chip's area, delay, and power
  - title: Machine Learning Intern
    company: TUKL Deep Learning Lab, NUST
    location: Islamabad
    year: June 2021 - September 2021
    responsibilities:
      - Implemented an automated pipeline to extract, structure, and preprocess raw court documents
      - Fine-tuned Transformer-based models for court-case outcome prediction achieving 83% accuracy
