Software-Defined Networking (SDN) architectures introduce unique security challenges due to their centralized control plane. This project addresses these challenges by implementing an intelligent Intrusion Detection System that leverages machine learning and deep learning techniques to identify malicious network traffic in real-time.

## System Architecture

The detection system operates at the SDN controller level, analyzing network flows as they traverse the data plane. By positioning the IDS at this critical juncture, we can intercept and classify traffic before it reaches critical network resources.

## Machine Learning Models

The system implements multiple classification models to compare detection accuracy and performance:

- **Random Forest Classifier**: Ensemble method providing robust baseline detection
- **Deep Neural Networks**: Multi-layer perceptron for complex pattern recognition
- **LSTM Networks**: Sequence-based detection for temporal attack patterns

Each model was trained on standard network intrusion datasets and fine-tuned for SDN-specific attack vectors including controller saturation, flow table overflow, and topology poisoning attacks.

## CloudLab Deployment

The system was deployed on CloudLab infrastructure, enabling:

- **Real-time Traffic Monitoring**: Live flow analysis with sub-second detection latency
- **Scalable Multi-node Testing**: Distributed deployment across multiple physical hosts
- **Reproducible Experiments**: Consistent testbed environment for benchmarking

## Implementation Stack

- **Python**: Core implementation language for ML models and SDN controller integration
- **Mininet**: Network emulation for development and initial testing
- **Ryu Framework**: SDN controller providing OpenFlow interface
- **scikit-learn & TensorFlow**: Machine learning frameworks for model development
- **CloudLab**: Production testing infrastructure

## Key Results

The system achieved detection accuracy exceeding 95% for common attack types while maintaining low false positive rates. Real-time processing capabilities enabled flow classification with average latency under 100ms, suitable for production SDN environments.

The deployment demonstrated that machine learning-based intrusion detection can operate effectively at network scale, providing an additional security layer for modern software-defined infrastructure.
