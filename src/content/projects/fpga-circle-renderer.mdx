This project implements hardware-accelerated graphics rendering on an FPGA, demonstrating how geometric algorithms can be translated into parallel digital logic for real-time visual effects. By implementing Bresenham's Circle Algorithm directly in Verilog, the system achieves smooth animation without any software overhead.

## Bresenham's Circle Algorithm in Hardware

Bresenham's algorithm is traditionally a software technique for efficient circle rendering using only integer arithmetic. This project reimagines the algorithm as a hardware state machine, where each clock cycle advances the circle drawing process.

The hardware implementation exploits the eight-way symmetry of circles, calculating only one octant and mirroring pixels to the other seven octants simultaneously. This parallelism reduces the time to draw a complete circle by a factor of eight compared to a sequential implementation.

## VGA Driver Integration

The circle renderer connects to a custom VGA driver module that handles the precise timing requirements of analog VGA displays. The driver generates:

- Horizontal sync pulses at 31.5 kHz
- Vertical sync pulses at 60 Hz
- Pixel clock signals at 25.175 MHz
- RGB color signals for each pixel

The circle renderer writes pixel data to a framebuffer, which the VGA driver continuously scans to generate the display output. This architecture decouples rendering logic from display timing, allowing complex graphics operations without disrupting the VGA signal.

## Real-Time Animation

The system achieves smooth real-time animation by continuously updating circle parameters—position, radius, color—and re-rendering at display refresh rates. Animation techniques include:

- **Position interpolation**: Circles move smoothly across the screen
- **Radius animation**: Circles grow and shrink organically
- **Color transitions**: Smooth color gradients and pulsing effects
- **Multiple simultaneous circles**: Parallel rendering of independent geometric objects

All animation logic runs in parallel hardware, maintaining consistent 60 FPS performance regardless of scene complexity within resource constraints.

## Resource Efficiency

FPGA resources are precious, and this design demonstrates efficient utilization:

**Logic Elements**: The circle renderer uses minimal combinational logic by leveraging Bresenham's integer-only arithmetic. No floating-point operations or expensive division operations are required.

**Memory**: A dual-port RAM framebuffer enables simultaneous rendering (write) and display (read) operations. The memory size scales with display resolution—a 640×480 display with 8-bit color requires less than 5 Mbit.

**Clock Speed**: The design operates comfortably within typical FPGA clock speeds, with the most demanding timing path being pixel data routing to the VGA output pins.

## Implementation Details

- **Verilog HDL**: Complete system description including circle renderer, VGA driver, and framebuffer management
- **Modular Architecture**: Separate modules for each functional block enable easy modification and reuse
- **Parameterizable Design**: Circle count, screen resolution, and color depth are configurable parameters
- **FPGA Platform**: Designed for common development boards (DE1-SoC, Basys3, etc.)

## Applications

This project's techniques extend beyond simple circle rendering:

- Graphics accelerators for embedded displays
- Real-time data visualization (oscilloscopes, spectrum analyzers)
- Video game graphics engines
- Scientific visualization on FPGA-based systems
- UI rendering for FPGA soft processors

The project proves that with careful algorithm selection and hardware design, FPGAs can deliver impressive graphics performance with minimal resource consumption—no GPU required.
