This project brings voice control to home automation through an embedded system built around the ESP32 microcontroller. By implementing on-device wake-word detection using TinyML, the system responds instantly to voice commands without requiring cloud connectivity, ensuring both privacy and reliability.

## System Overview

The automation system consists of three main components working in concert:

- **ESP32 development board** with microphone module
- **WiFi-controlled relay modules** for device switching
- **Responsive web dashboard** for monitoring and control

## TinyML Wake-Word Detection

The system implements local wake-word detection using machine learning models optimized for microcontroller execution. This approach offers several advantages:

**Privacy**: Audio processing happens entirely on-device—no voice data transmitted to external servers.

**Latency**: Sub-100ms wake-word detection enables near-instantaneous response.

**Reliability**: System operates independently of internet connectivity.

The neural network model was trained on custom wake-word datasets and quantized for efficient inference on the ESP32's limited computational resources. Despite running on a microcontroller, detection accuracy exceeds 90% in typical household noise conditions.

## WiFi-Enabled Device Control

Once activated by the wake-word, the system accepts voice commands to control connected devices. The ESP32 communicates with WiFi-enabled relays and smart devices using standard protocols:

- HTTP REST APIs for device control
- MQTT messaging for event coordination
- WebSocket connections for real-time status updates

Commands are parsed locally using keyword matching and simple natural language understanding, allowing control of lights, fans, appliances, and other connected devices.

## Web Interface

A mobile-responsive web interface provides an alternative control method and system monitoring capabilities:

- Real-time device status display
- Manual override controls for all connected devices
- Command history and system logs
- Wake-word detection confidence visualization
- Network diagnostics and system health monitoring

The interface is built with modern web technologies, automatically adapting its layout for smartphones, tablets, and desktop browsers.

## Key Features

- On-device ML inference requiring no cloud connectivity
- Multi-device coordination for complex automation scenarios
- Fallback manual control via web interface
- Extensible architecture supporting additional device types
- Low power consumption suitable for always-on operation

This project demonstrates that sophisticated voice control capabilities once requiring cloud infrastructure can now run entirely on affordable embedded hardware, bringing privacy-respecting voice automation within reach of DIY enthusiasts and small-scale deployments.
