CryptoProve automatically verifies security properties of cryptographic protocols using a combination of symbolic execution and SMT solving. It has discovered several previously unknown vulnerabilities in production protocols.

## Capabilities

- **Protocol Analysis**: Verify TLS, SSH, and custom protocols
- **Vulnerability Detection**: Automatically find security flaws
- **Correctness Proofs**: Generate machine-checked proofs

## Impact

- 623 GitHub stars
- Used by 15+ academic research labs
- Found 12 previously unknown vulnerabilities
