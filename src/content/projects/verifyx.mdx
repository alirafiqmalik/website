VerifyX is a comprehensive verification framework that combines SMT-based reasoning with symbolic execution to verify complex distributed protocols. It has been used to verify several real-world systems including Raft, Paxos, and custom blockchain consensus protocols.

## Key Features

- **Compositional Reasoning**: Verify components independently and compose proofs
- **Symbolic Execution**: Explore program paths systematically
- **SMT Integration**: Leverage Z3 for constraint solving
- **LLVM Support**: Analyze compiled code directly

## Usage Statistics

- 847 GitHub stars
- 50+ organizations using in production
